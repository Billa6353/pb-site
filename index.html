        <h3>To my dearest drø,</h3>
        <p>Happy Valentine’s Day, my sweetheart.</p>
        <p>I love you more than words could ever hold, and I always will — for eternity. Today is just a small excuse to remind you how deeply and endlessly I love you. I am forever yours.</p>
        <p>You make me feel complete in ways I never knew I needed. I’m so grateful for you — for your love, your patience, your strength. Thank you for always being by my side, for being my safe place and my pillar of support.</p>
        <p>I promise to stand beside you too — in laughter and in storms, in victories and in struggles, in happiness and in the hardest days. No matter what life brings, I choose you. Every single time.</p>
        <p>You are a blessing in my life, and I will always cherish you. Not just for now, not just for this lifetime, but for every lifetime where my soul is lucky enough to find yours again.</p>
        <p>I love you — endlessly, completely, eternally❤️</p>
